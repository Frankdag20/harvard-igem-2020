# Harvard College iGEM 2020
Welcome to the Harvard College iGEM 2020 Github page! Here, we host some of the code we used to make our ensemble model to try to optimize current SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to put in a DNA nanostructure to serve as an effective therapeutic. We also have code that is freely accessible for use to implement a function of Interpol (an R package) in Python! With our function and file, you can convert any protein sequence into a vector of numerical values easily! Please check out our wiki here: https://2020.igem.org/Team:Harvard

Also, be sure to check out Interpol here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3138420/
